    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello my name is Rishab Mudliar and I am from Nagpur, Maharashtra. Currently I am in my second semester of Computer Science Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam, Kerala. A little bit of background there so you know about me.

    Interests
  </h1>
<p>So I like to read books very much.
   I have read like 70+ books(I don’t count them, actually I do but I forgot the number)  till now since I started with my first book in 5th standard. I like to play cricket(who doesn’t?) and I like to play video games(again, who doesn’t?).
   I also like to write poems and I have written some.</p>

So before coming here I really did not know much about this field. When I was trying to get into the club in the first semester I was actually unsuccessful. And then I focussed to improve my skills.  Web Development was something that really fascinated me always and I wanted to explore that field so I started with a Udemy course based on Web Development and I really liked doing that and I learned about new things. Another thing I like doing is Problem Solving. I do participate in contests occasionally since I like to do Problem-Solving as well. </p>

My Work

<p>
So in the past two months I was working on a technology called IoT (Internet of Things). So first I started with understanding protocols and learned in very detail about the various protocols required. I learned about the OSI model and learned about various protocols starting from Application Layer to Physical Layer. I have done a lot of research on how protocols work and even wrote a blog on it. I have completed over 3 courses on Coursera related to IoT and watched over 44 videos to be exact on Arduino Programming. Though I have worked a lot but I still feel inside that I want to work on my topic of interest i.e Web Development. Next section will display a project I have done on it. I also started working on an IoT based project called Smart Traffic Lights in which by the help of sensors can release the traffic for the road that has more people. After releasing the traffic, it will once again check for the road that has most traffic (in case of a crossroads) and then release that traffic and so on. Based on this data other users can even see the statistics by installing an app and can start their journey according to the real-time data shown. Unfortunately I am not working on this anymore since I want to work on web-based applications and explore Django more.

Project on Django.

<p>
When I was asked what did I like, my answer was that I have an interest in Web Development and so I was given a project related to it. Working on the project assigned to me was really a great experience and I wanted to work on a lot more but then I was assigned IoT so yeah I was a bit disappointed, to be honest but still I tried to give my best. Here’s a link to my repository using Django.
